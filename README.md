###How to play the game
In this game you are a boy who badly wants to cross to street to jump into water.

In the process of repeatedly making your way to the water, your goal is to amass as many points as possible.

One way to get points is to cross the street and reach the water. Whenever you do, you will get 100 points and you will start back in your starting position.

Be careful though! There are evil, huge motherf**king bugs that are out to kill you. If you touch the bugs, you lose all your points and start over.

Another way to win points is to collect gems. Gems appear in the street in random locations. The rarer a gem, the more points it gets you. 

The following number of points will be awarded if you pick up a gem:  
* The blue gem gets you 100 points. 
* The green gem 200. 
* The orange gem, the rarest of them all, gets you 500 points! 

You have to be quick though. Because if it wasn't bad enough that these bugs want to devour your flesh, they are also out to steal all the gems. What would a bug even need gems for?

Good luck.
